\section{Pole Installation}
After surveying the entire plat, the poles are installed on center with a $\pm$10cm tolerance, per Figure \ref{fig:poles}.  The number of rows and poles per row is set by the hex order.  Table \ref{tab:hexnums} shows important numbers for different orders.

\begin{tabular}{| l | l |} \hline
order & total number \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\label{tab:hexnums}
\end{table}

\section{Pole Height}
Each trio of poles supports an antenna and each interior pole is shared by three antennas.  A fiducial constant height must be measured for each trio and marked with a small eye-bolt.  From within the circle circumscribed by the poles, this height may be measured by a theodolite along a bubble-level line or by a total station at constant $z$.  This height should be about 1.5-meters above the ground.

\section{Hub Centering and Leveling}
With each pole with a constant height eye-bolt, the following is used to center the hub center:
\subsection{Radial lines}
A arrangement of three fixed length lines and three match spring attached on a small inner ring with a plumb-bob is used. See Figure refPicture.

\subsection{Jig}
With the center point defined by the radial lines and hanging bob, a jig as described below is used.
